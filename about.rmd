My name is Clayton Pollard (BEd,BSc(Adv)). I'm a high school teacher from NSW, Australia.

During the 2020 Easter holidays I started looking around for different ways of delivering content to my students. I taught myself a bit of markdown, R markdown and git and I've got this little (for now!) website going.  I hope to have notes available for all the content in the NSW Mathematics syllabus, and then maybe HSC Chemistry in future!

If you'd be happy to share your own resources, I'd be glad to add them under the 'Additional Resources' pages. You can email me <a href="mailto:clayton.pollard@det.nsw.edu.au">here</a> and we can work something out!

[Here](https://claytonpollard.github.io/Rmd-testing/index.html) you can see what I'm playing around with before I start including it in my notes.
